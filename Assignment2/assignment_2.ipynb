The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",

That's for you to decide.\n",

In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model).

        "\n",
        "##### (a). My approach uses a bi-directional N-gram model (forward and reverse) for character prediction, based on surrounding context. In the preprocessing step, I pad each word with special characters ($$$) to account for boundaries and then calculate the 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram, and 4-gram probabilities in both forward and reverse directions.  These probabilities are then used to estimate the likelihood of each unguessed character.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### (b). For each prediction, the algorithm preferentially matches the largest N-gram (i.e., starting with 4-gram and demoting to 3-gram, 2-gram, and 1-gram if there is no match) to obtain the most accurate context information. If no larger N-gram is matched, the algorithm uses a smaller N-gram to ensure that the context information is as complete as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Hyper-parameter & Result:\n",
        "##### (a). I applied log-probability to avoid possible underflow problems caused by n-grams and smoothing to avoid zero probabilities for unseen N-grams. And the smoothing parameter (0.15) was tuned to balance between underfitting and overfitting. The combination of forward and reverse probabilities was calculated by the same weight importance, with alpha = 0.5 to balance the contribution of both directions. The character with the highest combined score is selected as the guess.\n",
